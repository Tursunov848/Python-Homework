    "# Task 1 - Create your own virtual environment and install some python packages.\n",

    "# First, I made sure that Python was already installed on my system by running python --version in the Command Prompt. Once I confirmed it was installed, I navigated to the folder where I wanted to keep my project using the cd command. After that, I created a virtual environment by typing python -m venv venv — this basically set up an isolated Python environment in a folder named \"venv\" within my project directory. Once the environment was created, I activated it using venv\\Scripts\\activate, and I could tell it worked because the command line showed the environment name in parentheses at the start of the prompt. Then, while inside the virtual environment, I used pip install to add the packages I needed — for example, pip install pandas numpy matplotlib to install popular data-related libraries. If I ever want to deactivate the virtual environment, I just type deactivate. That's it — now I have a clean, isolated setup for working on my Python project without affecting the global Python installation."
